# k8s-snapshots need EBS and S3 permissions to take and save snapshots.
# Under the kops IAM Role scheme, only Masters have these permissions.
# The easiest solution was to run k8s-snapshots on Masters. See
# https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2545?focusedCommentId=28509&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-28509

# To run on a Master, we need to:
# * overcome a Taint -- see
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/
#
# * specify that we require a Master -- see
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/
